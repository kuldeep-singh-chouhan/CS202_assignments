------------------- Sudoku Pair Solver and Generator -------------------

Problem Statement:
Given a sudoku pair in a CSV File, of size D (D = 3 means 9x9 Sudoku), we
are required to solve them, such that no two corresponding cells of them
does not contain the same value.

We will use Minisat22 Solver for solving the sudoku-pair using CNF encoding.
CardEnc will be used to create clauses for different conditions.

sudoku.py contains the script for encoding the sudoku, and it also returns
True or False depending upon whether the problem is solvable or not. If it
is solvable, we would run the print_sud.py to print the solution.

Example 1:

input.csv contains following matrix

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
